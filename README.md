My experiments with blogging and Gatsby. If you want blog like my, try Gatsby cloud and theme Novela.

# Gatsby Starter Novela

With minimal styling and maximum features — including multiple homepage layouts, built-in social sharing and dark mode — Novela makes it easy to start publishing beautiful articles and stories with Gatsby.

Novela is built by the team at [Narative](https://www.narative.co), and built for everyone that loves the web.
